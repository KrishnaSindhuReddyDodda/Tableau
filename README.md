# Tableau
with Sample-Super Store Dataset


Tableau is a data visualization tool or business intelligence tool which analyzes and shows data in a chart. In this data is displayed in more sophisticated ways such as dials and gauges, geographic maps, heat maps, pie chart, and fever chart. In this project we have used Super Store dataset in which it contains three tables (Orders, returns, users).
